**How about Segoe UI? I love it and would like to include that in my non-Windows app or game. Is it available from [Monotype](https://www.fonts.com/content/microsoft-typography)?**

No, as Segoe UI is both our user interface and corporate branding font, it is not available for use outside of Microsoft products on non-Windows platforms. However, we do have a Segoe-compatible open-source font you can use:â€¯[Selawik](https://github.com/Microsoft/Selawik).
